# SSH_Bruteforce
There are two approaches for the same problem
The sshbrute.py uses a simple SSH bruteforce attack for a specific targert that the user inputs.
The program tries to find a correct password from a given file.
The passwords.txt file is an example file and is not recomended for actual use.
The sshbrutethreaded.py uses the same logic and also makes use of threads for a faster solution to the attack.
